1. introduction to python
2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python 3 
3. PCA


## Example Class 2 
1. Never use 'print()' to debug again! Pysnooper is all you need!
2. Lasso Regression using scikit-learn :) 
3. Application of tree-based methods with SKlearn, including, decision tree, random forest, boosting. 
4. Implementation of Decision Tree from scratch

## Example Class 3 Kernel Based Method 
1. Kernel regression review
2. Kernel regression implementation from scratch [Simplified example for HW3]

## Example Class 4 
1. A1 & A2 extension: Implementation of Lasso Logistic Regression for Binary Classification from scratch

2. GAM

3. Implementation of Naive Bayes from scratch

4. Implementation of K-Means Clustering from scratch
