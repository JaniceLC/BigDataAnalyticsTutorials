              "'                  THE THREE LITTLE PIGS\\n\\n   Once upon a time . . . there were three little pigs, who left their mummy\\nand daddy to see the world.\\n   All summer long, they roamed through the woods and over the plains,playing\\ngames and having fun. None were happier than the three little pigs, and they\\neasily made friends with everyone. Wherever they went, they were given a warm \\nwelcome, but as summer drew to a close, they realized that folk were drifting\\nback to their usual jobs, and preparing for winter. Autumn came and it began\\nto rain. The three little pigs started to feel they needed a real home. Sadly\\nthey knew that the fun was over now and they must set to work like the others,\\nor they\\'d be left in the cold and rain, with no roof over their heads. They\\ntalked about what to do, but each decided for himself. The laziest little pig\\nsaid he\\'d build a straw hut.\\n   \"It wlll only take a day,\\' he said. The others disagreed.\\n   \"It\\'s too fragile,\" they said disapprovingly, but he refused to listen. Not\\nquite so lazy, the second little pig went in search of planks of seasoned\\nwood.\\n   \"Clunk! Clunk! Clunk!\" It took him two days to nail them together. But the\\nthird little pig did not like the wooden house.\\n   \"That\\'s not the way to build a house!\" he said. \"It takes time, patience \\nand hard work to buiid a house that is strong enough to stand up to wind, \\nrain, and snow, and most of all, protect us from the wolf!\"\\n   The days went by, and the wisest little pig\\'s house took shape, brick by\\nbrick. From time to time, his brothers visited him, saying with a chuckle:\\n   \"Why are you working so hard? Why don\\'t you come and play?\" But the\\nstubborn bricklayer pig just said \"no\".\\n   \"I shall finish my house first. It must be solid and sturdy. And then I\\'ll\\ncome and play!\" he said. \"I shall not be foolish like you! For he who laughs\\nlast, laughs longest!\"\\n   It was the wisest little pig that found the tracks of a big wolf in the\\nneighbourhood.\\n   The little pigs rushed home in alarm. Along came the wolf, scowling \\nfiercely at the laziest pig\\'s straw hut.\\n   \"Come out!\" ordered the wolf, his mouth watering. I want to speak to you!\"\\n   \"I\\'d rather stay where I am!\" replied the little pig in a tiny voice.\\n   \"I\\'ll make you come out!\" growled the wolf angrily, and puffing out his\\nchest, he took a very deep breath. Then he blew wlth all his might, right onto\\nthe house. And all the straw the silly pig had heaped against some thin poles,\\nfell down in the great blast. Excited by his own cleverness, the wolf did not\\nnotice that the little pig had slithered out from underneath the heap of\\nstraw, and was dashing towards his brother\\'s wooden house. When he realized \\nthat the little pig was escaping, the wolf grew wild with rage.\\n   \"Come back!\" he roared, trying to catch the pig as he ran into the wooden \\nhouse. The other little pig greeted his brother, shaking like a leaf.\\n   \"I hope this house won\\'t fall down! Let\\'s lean against the door so he can\\'t\\nbreak in!\"\\n   Outside, the wolf could hear the little pigs\\' words. Starving as he was, at\\nthe idea of a two-course meal, he rained blows on the door.\\n   \"Open up! Open up! I only want to speak to you!\"\\n   Inside, the two brothers wept in fear and did their best to hold the door\\nfast against the blows. Then the furious wolf braced himself a new effort: he\\ndrew in a really enormous breath, and went ... WHOOOOO! The wooden house\\ncollapsed like a pack of cards.\\n   Luckily, the wisest little pig had been watching the scene from the window\\nof his own brick house, and he rapidly opened the door to his fleeing \\nbrothers. And not a moment too soon, for the wolf was already hammering \\nfuriously on the door. This time, the wolf had grave doubts. This house had a\\nmuch more solid air than the others. He blew once, he blew again and then for\\na third time. But all was in vain. For the house did not budge an lnch. The\\nthree little pigs watched him and their fear began to fade. Quite exhausted by\\nhis efforts, the wolf decided to try one of his tricks. He scrambled up a\\nnearby ladder, on to the roof to have a look at the chimney. However, the\\nwisest little pig had seen thls ploy, and he quickly said:\\n   \"Quick! Light the fire!\" With his long legs thrust down the chimney, the\\nwolf was not sure if he should slide down the black hole. It wouldn\\'tbe easy\\nto get in, but the sound of the little pigs\\' voices below only made him feel\\nhungrier.\\n   \"I\\'m dying of hunger! I\\'m goin to try and get down.\" And he let himself \\ndrop. But landing was rather hot, too hot! The wolf landed in the fire, stunned\\nby his fall.\\n   The flames licked his hairy coat and his tail became a flaring torch.\\n   \"Never again! Never again will I go down a chimneyl\" he squealed, as he\\ntried to put out the flames in his tail. Then he ran away as fast as he could.\\n   The three happy little pigs, dancing round and round the yard, began to \\nsing:\\n   \"Tra-la-la! Tra-la-la! The wicked black wolf will never come back...!\"\\n   From that terrible day on, the wisest little pig\\'s brothers set to work\\nwith a will. In less than no time, up went the two new brick houses. The wolf\\ndid return once to roam in the neighbourhood, but when he caught sight of\\nthree chimneys, he remembered the terrible pain of a burnt tail, and he left\\nfor good.\\n   Now safe and happy, the wisest little pig called to his brothers:\\n   \"No more work! Come on, let\\'s go and play!\"\\n'"
