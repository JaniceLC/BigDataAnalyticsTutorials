        "\n",
        "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a method of structuring a program by bundling related properties and behaviors into individual objects. In this tutorial, you’ll learn the basics of object-oriented programming in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "Conceptually, objects are like the components of a system. Think of a program as a factory assembly line of sorts. At each step of the assembly line a system component processes some material, ultimately transforming raw material into a finished product.\n",
        "\n",
        "An object contains data, like the raw or preprocessed materials at each step on an assembly line, and behavior, like the action each assembly line component performs.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Create a class, which is like a blueprint for creating an object\n",
        "- Use classes to create new objects\n",
        "- Model systems with class inheritance\n",

        "## What is Object-Oriented Programming in Python? \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual **objects**.\n",
        "\n",
        "For instance, an object could represent a person with properties like a name, age, and address and behaviors such as walking, talking, breathing, and running. Or it could represent an email with properties like a recipient list, subject, and body and behaviors like adding attachments and sending.\n",
        "\n",
        "Put another way, object-oriented programming is an approach for modeling concrete, real-world things, like cars, as well as relations between things, like companies and employees, students and teachers, and so on. OOP models real-world entities as software objects that have some data associated with them and can perform certain functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "For comparison, another common programming paradigm is procedural programming, which structures a program like a recipe in that it provides a set of steps, in the form of functions and code blocks, that flow sequentially in order to complete a task.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The key takeaway is that objects are at the center of object-oriented programming in Python, not only representing the data, as in procedural programming, but in the overall structure of the program as well.\n",

        "For example, let’s say you want to track employees in an organization. You need to store some basic information about each employee, such as their name, age, position, and the year they started working.\n",
